I wanted to share some lovely coverage from Elizabeth Pennisi, reporter at Science, of two awesome talks I attended at SICB 2025 (Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology). Partially because I was quoted in the body and the title! But it's also just quite a cool phenomenon that I definitely was not aware of prior, and I would love it if more people were aware because it's yet another reason to love dragonflies! The TL;DR is that dragonflies occasionally dunk in the water and then spin super quickly to dry themselves off. But you should really read the whole article below, and watch the amazing videos by Huai-Ti Lin and his lab!
