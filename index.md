# Welcome!

My name is Brady Nichols and I am a first-year PhD student in the [Animal Behavior Graduate Group](https://anb.ucdavis.edu/) (ABGG) and the [Combes Lab](https://combeslab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. I haven't really begun serious research in grad school yet, but I broadly plan to work on the interplay between biomechanics and insect ecology covering topics like turbulence, predator-prey interactions, biogeography, and paleobiomechanics.

Poke around to learn more about me and the work that I do, see some of my art, and read some of my writing! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, my email is in the footer. Have a great day!

# Writing
My most recent piece is a "creature feature" about the aggregating anemone, *Anthopleura elegantissima*, on the ABGG's official blog, The Ethogram! Read it here: [https://theethogram.com/2024/09/17/creature-feature-aggregating-anemone/](https://theethogram.com/2024/09/17/creature-feature-aggregating-anemone/)
