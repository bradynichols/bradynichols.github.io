# Welcome!

My name is Brady Nichols and I am a first-year PhD student in the [Animal Behavior Graduate Group](https://anb.ucdavis.edu/) (ABGG) and the [Combes Lab](https://combeslab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. My background is in math and physics and I aim to apply that to thinking about insect flight in cool ways.

Poke around to learn more about me and the work that I do, see some of my art, and read some of my writing! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, my email is in the footer. Have a great day!

# Writing
Science writing is somewhat of a new interest; I've written / edited a few pieces for [The Ethogram](https://theethogram.com/), the official blog of my graduate group, and put those articles + some extras on the [Blog/Writing](../blog) page here.

My longest piece is a "creature feature" about the aggregating anemone, *Anthopleura elegantissima*, which you can find here: [https://theethogram.com/2024/09/17/creature-feature-aggregating-anemone/](https://theethogram.com/2024/09/17/creature-feature-aggregating-anemone/)
