# Welcome!

My name is Brady Nichols and I am a second-year PhD student in the [Animal Behavior Graduate Group](https://anb.ucdavis.edu/) (ABGG) and the [Combes Lab](https://combeslab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. My background is in math and physics and I am currently working on applying that to learn about how insects fly in turbulence.

# Writing
[SICB Student Journalism Piece](https://sicb.org/sicb-news/doing-the-righting-thing-how-leaping-water-striders-achieve-a-perfect-landing/) - Result from an interview I conducted as part of my funding for SICB 2025

[The Ethogram](https://theethogram.com/) - Official blog of my graduate group. I've written a "Creature Feature" found here: [https://theethogram.com/2024/09/17/creature-feature-aggregating-anemone/](https://theethogram.com/2024/09/17/creature-feature-aggregating-anemone/), and I've been the editor of the [Field Frame Fridays](https://theethogram.com/category/field-frame/) column for some time (and we are always accepting submission!)
