# Welcome!

My name is Brady Nichols and I am a first-year PhD student in the [Animal Behavior Graduate Group](https://anb.ucdavis.edu/) and the [Combes Lab](https://combeslab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. I haven't really begun serious research in grad school yet, but I broadly plan to work on the interplay between physics and insect ecology covering topics like turbulence, predator-prey interactions, biogeography, and paleobiomechanics.

Poke around to learn more about me and the work that I do, see some of my art, and read some of my writing! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, my email is in the footer. Have a great day!

<!-- My name is Brady Nichols and I'm a senior (c/o 2024) at Bowdoin College studying math and phyics with an ecology & evolutionary biology minor. I'm primarily interested in comparative biomechanics, or more broadly applications of math and physics to answering questions in ecology and evolution, and I hope to update this website with "starting [x] PhD program in Fall 2024" within the few months! -->

<!-- I was originally inspired to start this blog because throughout undergrad I enjoyed watching some PhD vloggers (namely [Simon Clark](https://www.youtube.com/@SimonClark)) and it got me lots of valuable insight into the process that made me very excited to go through with it, especially since they spoke a lot about the good parts of doing a PhD which it seems are rarely stated on other communities i.e. Reddit. I also journal anyway, and I am broadly interested in science writing, so maintaining a blog holds me accountable for cleaning up some of my journal entries and gets me some practice communicating science. In general I hope that this blog can foster some interest in my favorite subset of science, and give people some insight into the PhD life. I'll also probably throw random philosophical things here or there when I feel comfortable enough. -->

<!-- Anyway, I thank you greatly for stopping by, and feel free to reach out whether you are someone interested in my research or writing or a high schooler or undergrad looking for some advice.
