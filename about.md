As noted in the home page, my name is Brady Nichols and I'm a senior (class of 2024) at Bowdoin College studying **math and physics** with a minor in **ecology and evolutionary biology**. Currently on the academic side of life, I'm occupied with applying to PhD programs and conducting my senior honors project on **sea star locomotion**. I hope to keep working in **organismal biomechanics**, combining my quantitative background with interesting experiments and field work to learn about the physical mechanisms underpining ecology and evolution. I am also **broadly interested in science communication** and while I'm not sure what role I want that to play in my academic life yet, I plan to put extra effort into the way I write about my research so that it is comprehensible to people of many different backgrounds so that I can do my part to make the scientific world a bit more interconnected.

Outside of academics I like **rock climbing**, **running** (especially on trails!), **birding**, and **journaling or reading** while drinking tea or coffee pretending that I am a movie protagonist in a fancy café. I also occasionally play clarinet (in concert band here at Bowdoin) and ultimate frisbee.
