As noted in the home page, I am a first-year PhD student in the [Animal Behavior Graduate Group](https://anb.ucdavis.edu/) and the [Combes Lab](https://combeslab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. My research interests are iterated in more detail in [Research](../research); here is where you get to learn more about me.

Before coming to California, I did my undergrad in math and physics with a biology minor at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. I had a pretty nonlinear trajectory entering as a biology major, doing a total 180 and getting interested in pure math, and eventually settling down in this weird but awesome middle ground we call biomechanics thanks to Amy Johnson's biomechanics course. 

I occasionally go outside: rock climbing, biking, and birding are the big ones. I also enjoy reading pop science from all fields. Bernd Heinrich, John McPhee, and Steven Vogel were some of my biggest influences for getting into writing.
