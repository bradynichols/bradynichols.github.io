As noted in the home page, I am a first-year PhD student in the [Animal Behavior Graduate Group](https://anb.ucdavis.edu/) and the [Combes Lab](https://combeslab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. My research interests are iterated in more detail in [Research](../research); here is where you get to learn more about me.

Before coming to California, I did my undergrad in math and physics with a biology minor at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. I had a pretty nonlinear trajectory entering as a biology major, doing a total 180 and getting interested in mathematical physics, and eventually settling down in this weird but awesome middle ground we call biomechanics thanks to Amy Johnson's biomechanics course. 

I occasionally go outside: rock climbing, biking, and birding are the big ones. I also enjoy reading, generally nonfiction science (be it pop science or heavier content to keep my math and physics skills sharp) but I also like a good fantasy or sci-fi novel and am always in the market for book recommendations. The authors John McPhee and Steven Vogel in particular inspired the start of my writing career which admittedly has not been very long thus far, but I hope to continue to work on.
