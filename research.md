# THIS PAGE IS THE MOST WIP OF THEM ALL!! SORRY BOUT THAT.

This page is more of an animated write-up of my interests. For a comprehensive list of my one publication thus far, see my [CV](../about).

# Current interests
On the home page I mentioned that 

`I broadly plan to work on the interplay between physics and insect ecology covering topics like turbulence, predator-prey interactions, biogeography, and paleobiomechanics.`

but what heck does this all mean?
