This page is more of an animated write-up of my interests. For a comprehensive list of my one publication thus far, see my [CV](../about).

Note: It's also quite a WIP. Stay tuned!

# Current interests: damselflies, wind, and prehistory
On the home page I mentioned that 

`I broadly plan to work on the interplay between biomechanics and insect ecology covering topics like turbulence, predator-prey interactions, biogeography, and paleobiomechanics.`

but what heck does this all mean?

In my interpretation, biomechanics is broadly the application of both tools and approaches from math/physics/engineering to look at biological phenomena through the lens of the physical forces that affect them in order to answer questions about how they work, how they came to evolve, what they can teach us, and much more. Ecology is the general study of interactions between living things. Insects are of course those cute little 6-legged guys. Tying together turbulence and predator prey interactions is a great example of all of this. 

When an insect, say for example a [damselfly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damselfly), pursues its prey, they interact: the damselfly takes pursuit, the prey notices (if it's lucky) and tries to flee, and a game ensues. Maybe the damselfly wins and secures a meal, maybe the prey wins and wastes some of the damselfly's energy. Now if they played the same game in a turbulent environment (or just imagine a very windy one), the results might be skewed differently: maybe the damselfly, with its many years of evolution as a predator, has evolved strategies to deal with this, and the prey simply spirals with air into its doom. Or perhaps the damselfly is much larger than the prey, and thus feels the effects of turbulence differently, causing it to be destabilized and thrown off its path more than the prey. To fully understand this phenomenon, we would probably have to consider many different things, including physical theory (how should turbulence differentially affect organisms of different sizes?), ecology (what kind of prey do these damselflies usually pursue?), and experimentation (what happens if we make damselflies hunt in a very windy box?). The results can then in turn open questions in many other fields, like evolution (why haven't the damselflies or prey evolved to deal with turbulence better?) or engineering (how can we take inspiration from these organisms to design aircraft to better handle flying in storms?). Biomechanics is very attractive to me because it lets me work on many different problems and study systems, and it forces me to use many different strengths of my thinking brain that I may otherwise lose if I were only doing pure math or biology or physics. 

Biogeography and paleobiomechanics are two of my favorite ways to use the implications of asking these kinds of questions. Biogeography generally concerns itself with the distribution of organisms throughout the world, and we could ask for example, can we explain some of the distribution of damselflies throughout the world knowing that they get better or worse at hunting in turbulent environments? Paleobiomechanics generally considers the function of organisms that have long gone extinct, so it may ask how the results of our study in the present day might inform our perception of predator-prey interactions long ago, when predators were way bigger and the air was very different in composition. I look forward to answering these types of questions because they lean very heavily into the storytelling aspect of science that I really love: how did things come to be this way? how were they before? how is it all connected?

# Past projects

## Sea star locomotion
This project got me started on biomechanics, and I conducted it throughout my senior year at Bowdoin with the guidance of Amy Johnson, Olaf Ellers, Dale Syphers, and Mary Lou Zeeman. More to come (including hopefully a paper!); in the meantime, [read my undergraduate thesis](https://digitalcommons.bowdoin.edu/honorsprojects/542/)! (Or just wait for the paper, it'll be a skosh more refined...)

## Kelp biomechanics
Kelp is a really cool system to do biomechanics on because you don't have to worry about any of that pesky behavior stuff! I fell in love with it during my time at the [UW Friday Harbor Labs](https://fhl.uw.edu/) taking Ecological Biomechanics with Emily Carrington and Mark Denny. More to come; in the meantime, check out the labs and see if any of their courses interest you! It was an amazing experience. 

## *Daphnia* ecotoxicology
This work I did as part of the [Rogalski Lab](https://maryrogalski.wordpress.com/research-themes/) at Bowdoin College. More to come; in the meantime, read [our paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eva.13668)!
